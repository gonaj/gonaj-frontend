# Gonaj Frontend (Phase-1)

This repository contains the web frontend for Gonaj.

## Governance

UI behavior is governed by the **UI Constitution** defined in the core repository:

- [docs/01_architecture/ui_constitution_v1.md](https://github.com/gonaj/gonaj-backend/blob/HEAD/docs/01_architecture/ui_constitution_v1.md)

This frontend is bound by:
- [ui_contract.md](docs/ui_contract.md)
- [design_review_checklist.md](docs/design_review_checklist.md)

If a UI change conflicts with system guarantees, the UI change is incorrect.

## Review Accountability

**A reviewer who approves a PR implicitly asserts Design Review Checklist compliance.**

Reviewers are accountable for constitutional violations, not just authors. Unchecked items in the Design Review Checklist are merge blockers.

## Phase-1 Scope

- Read-only traveller experience
- Honest uncertainty
- No edits, no authority, no predictions

Contribution UX is intentionally constrained.
