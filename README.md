# Gonaj Frontend (Phase-1)

This repository contains the web frontend for Gonaj.

## Governance

UI behavior is governed by the **UI Constitution** defined in the core repository:

- `docs/01_architecture/ui_constitution_v1.md`

This frontend is bound by:
- `UI_CONTRACT.md`
- `DESIGN_REVIEW_CHECKLIST.md`

If a UI change conflicts with system guarantees, the UI change is incorrect.

## Phase-1 Scope

- Read-only traveller experience
- Honest uncertainty
- No edits, no authority, no predictions

Contribution UX is intentionally constrained.
